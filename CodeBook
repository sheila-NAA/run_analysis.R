# The steps are below:
1. Merge the training and test datasets
1.1 Read files
1.1.1 Read training datasets
1.1.2 Read test datasets
1.1.3 read features and activity labels datasets
1.2 assign column names to datasets
1.3 merging all datasets
2 Extracting only the measurements on the mean and std for each measurement
2.1 reading column names
2.2 Creating vector for defining the activityno_, subjectno_, mean and std
2.3 Final extract

3. Using descriptive activity names to name the activities in the dataset

4. Appropriately labelling the the dataset with descriptive variable names. see 1.2, 1.3, 2.2, 2.3

5.  Create a second, independent tidy dataset with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject   
5.1 making second independent tidy dataset


## About variables:   
* `x_train`, `y_train`, `x_test`, `y_test`, `subject_train` and `subject_test` contain the data from the downloaded files.
* `x_data`, `y_data` and `subject_data` merge the previous datasets to further analysis.
* `features` contains the correct names for the `x_data` dataset, which are applied to the column names stored in
